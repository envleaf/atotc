A slice-of-life furry VN :3

 *Please note that this game is in very early stages of development! There will be significant errors in programming and storyline elements, and you will have to compile the game yourself (using Ren'Py) should you want to play this anytime soon. If you do decide to compile yourself, please give me feedback on both writing and programming!*

 *This game also contains a LOT of placeholder art! If you are interesting in doing commisions for this game, please reach out to me! I would love to have more art for this game made.*
