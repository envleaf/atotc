# currently this is mostly placeholder code left in by Ren'Py
# Nearly all code for this game is stored in individual files in the 'code' directory. This file is used purely as an index and calls functions from these other files. This feels wrong but idk any better ways of going about this when trying to keep dialouge organized so if you are a better programmer than me please tell me how to go about this better lmao
