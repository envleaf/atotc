        "Eventually, my hand wraps around the lukewarm can and I bring it to your lips. The semi-cool strawberry flavor is a shock to my mouth, and it stimulates me just enough to widen my eyes a tad more."
        "I glance over at your dashboard and check the time."

        "I try and count up the hours I've been driving in my head. It's been six hours, no? I left Amilie's at around 20:00."

        "I managed to get a three-month lease on a cheap apartment, with what meager funds I had after quitting my part-time job at Castle Rock. It looked pretty dingy from the online listing, but it's not like I had many other options."

        "I start to let myself unconcentrate before reminding myself that I'd probably die if I succumbed to the serenade my sedan's engine."
        "That's what I get for not at least taking a nap before I left, though."
        "Or booking a hotel. I probably should've done that..."

        "After quite a bit more time, I see a sea of lights over the horizon. Aurora city, grandious and shining brightly in the night sky."

        "As I begin to daydream about moving in, parking my car in the lot, grabbing the little I've packed with me and walking into the building, getting my key, et cetera, I remember that Amile wanted me to call her when I got close"

        a "Hnm? Oh, yeah! Did you make it okay, everything go smoothly?"
        e "Yeah, pretty uneventful. Well, I almost drove off the road while half-asleep, but, you know."
        a "Jesus, Evie, I told you to get some sleep before you left."
        e "I had to make sure everything would work, you know that."
        a "Yeah, but still, 'everything working' shouldn't mean risking your life."
        a "Still, I'm glad you're okay. Promise to call me tomorrow morning?"
