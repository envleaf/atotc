label setup:
    #Major Characters
    define e = Character("Evelyn")
    define l = Character("Luna")
    define a = Character("Amile")

    #Minor Characters
    define bgchar = ("[bgchar], color=#ffffff") #this is a variable character that is defined interchangebly right before it is called. this is used for when a character needs a name but only has one or two lines and is not worth defining another character for.
    # ^^ this thing does not work
